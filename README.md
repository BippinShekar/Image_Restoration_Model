# Image_Restoration_Model
We as a Team have created an Image Restoration Model implementing Convolutional Neural Networks and utilizing the principles of Sequential Learning. This model can be used to restore deteriorated images to a better quality. The Model has a max accuracy of 90%, while the average floats around 86%.
